    <div class="post-content">
      <p>December was a very <strong>Copilot</strong> month for me. After seeing some glimpses of new capabilities at <em>Directions</em> and more later at <em>Ignite</em>, I decided to spend some time trying out the <em>‚Äúnew‚Äù</em> features of <em>GitHub Copilot</em> in <em>Visual Studio Code</em>. They‚Äôre not really new; they‚Äôve been around for a while. I just never used them, as I thought they were <strong>not useful for AL development.</strong></p>

<p><em>Boy was I wrong‚Ä¶</em></p>

<p><em>Copilot is no longer just a fancy autocomplete‚Ä¶</em> <strong><em>it has become much more!</em></strong></p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt want to get my hopes up too much with <em>AL</em>, so I started testing everything out with more <em>mature</em> languages like <em>C#</em> and <em>TypeScript</em>, but the more I tried the new features with <em>AL</em>, the more I was convinced that I needed to start sharing that <strong>autocomplete is no longer the only useful part of Copilot!</strong></p>

<p>They‚Äôve now also introduced a <strong><em><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/about-github-copilot-free">free tier for GitHub Copilot</a>.</em></strong> This means everyone can now <em>‚Äújust try it‚Äù</em>, without any commitments!</p>

<p>For everyone who‚Äôs going to try Copilot out, or has been using it for a while, I wanted to share a few <strong>very concrete examples</strong> of how I‚Äôve been using features like <strong>Inline Chat</strong>, <strong>Copilot Edits</strong>, and <strong>Copilot Chat for AL</strong> (and a few for other languages), that will hopefully move you to explore more than just the <em>‚Äútab, tab, tab‚Äù</em> behavior of AI.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="auto-complete">Auto-complete</h2>

<p>I really won‚Äôt spend much time here, this is the first use-case you‚Äôve noticed, and it feels most natural. <em>Do you see a grey suggested code you like?</em> A tab and it‚Äôs yours üòâ</p>

<p>I use this all the time, from <em>procedure declaration</em>, and <em>adding fields</em>, to <em>commenting code</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/complete-procedure.png" alt="Auto-complete procedure declaration" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/complete-field.png" alt="Auto-complete field declaration" /></p>

<p>If you didn‚Äôt write quality ToolTips so far, then don‚Äôt expect quality ToolTips from Copilot</p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/complete-comment.png" alt="Auto-complete comment" /></p>

<p><em>Yeah, yeah,</em> it‚Äôs not a meaningful comment, but you get the idea.</p>

<hr />

<p>One very important note to keep in mind is <strong>how Copilot knows what to suggest</strong>. It looks at your open files and takes <strong>up to 4 files as context</strong>. If you‚Äôve got more than 4 opened, it <strong><em>tries</em></strong> to do its best to take something, which is not always the most appropriate file. So, if you want to have <strong>better Copilot suggestions</strong>, close the unrelated tabs and <strong>only keep the relevant ones open.</strong></p>

<p>I was used to having <em>tens of files opened</em>, so I needed to get used to <em>right-clicking</em> the tabs a lot and closing anything that was no longer relevant.</p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/close-tab.png" alt="Close tabs" /></p>

<p>The autocomplete is something you‚Äôll discover immediately, and even this feature alone saves enough time to fully justify the <em>20$</em> price tag of the <em>Pro</em> version.</p>

<p>The most interesting thing about autocomplete though? It‚Äôs <strong><a href="https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-next-edit-suggestions/">what‚Äôs coming to it next!</a></strong> Awesome feature, can‚Äôt wait for it to be released.</p>

<p>Anyway, let‚Äôs move on.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="copilot-edits">Copilot edits</h2>

<p>In my opinion, <strong>this is the game changer!</strong> This is the feature that <strong>turns coding into a conversation.</strong> A very brief description of it is a chatbot, that won‚Äôt only suggest you a code snippet that you should paste somewhere but goes in and <em>modifies</em> your files.</p>

<p>I first used it with a <em>C#</em> project, and <strong>I was blown away!</strong> I was working on some old code I wrote a year ago, and I asked Copilot to apply <em>best practices</em>. Within a few seconds my code was much more readable, had safe <em>typecasting</em>, used <em>HashSets</em> instead of <em>Lists</em>, and was just generally better code than I would ever write on my own. Devs that work with C# daily would still run circles around me as I <em>‚Äúcraft‚Äù</em> my prompts, but <strong>I made much better progress than I could without it.</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/csharp.png" alt="Apply best practices to C# code" /></p>

<p>Later I started playing with some <em>TypeScript</em>. I have very little knowledge of TypeScript, and it would probably take me days to learn the basics of <em>React</em> on top. But <strong>within a few hours</strong>, I was able to make an Azure DevOps extension in TypeScript that allows me to visualize Page Scripting yaml files directly in DevOps. It was such a fun journey. More on that in a separate post one day! :P</p>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; gap: 10px;">

    <img src="/images/copilotintro/pagescript-pretty.png" alt="Page Scripting YAML in pretty view" style="width: 48%;" />
</div>

<hr />

<p><em>Okay, okay, Tine, <strong>everything works great with C# and TypeScript</strong>, we‚Äôre here for AL, <strong>does it work with AL?</strong></em></p>

<p><strong><em>It does! And wonderfully so!</em></strong></p>

<p>Of course, not to the extent that it works with <em>C#</em>. You won‚Äôt get any meaningful best practices applied in <em>AL</em>. We still have the same issue of <strong><em>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not enough AL data to train these models‚Äù</em></strong>. But here are two very important parts that make <strong>Copilot Edits work so well for AL.</strong></p>

<p>First, you can <strong><em>select a different LLM model</em></strong> to power the code generation. <em>Autocomplete</em> is powered by <strong><em>GPT-4o</em></strong>, which is <em>‚Äúmeh‚Äù</em> for <em>AL</em>, but in <em>Copilot Edits</em>, you can switch between models.</p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/models.png" alt="Different models in Copilot Edits" /></p>

<p><strong><em>Claude 3.5 Sonnet is so much better when it comes to AL.</em></strong> <em>Why? I have no clue.</em> But it just is. So, if you‚Äôre going to play with Edits (or Chat and Inline) for <em>AL</em>, <strong><em>switch to Claude immediately!</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you don‚Äôt see Claude, you have to enable it in your <a href="https://github.com/settings/copilot">GitHub settings</a> (or if you‚Äôre getting your license through an organization, the organization admin has to enable it for you).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A better model is just part of the story though. The second part is <strong><em>‚Äúlimited scope‚Äù</em></strong>. I mentioned in the auto-complete part that it will look at <em>up to 4 open files</em> and try to give you a good suggestion. Well, with Edits <strong><em>you are in complete control of the context</em></strong> that the model receives.</p>

<p>You add files you‚Äôd like the model to consider to the working set. Either by <em>dragging and dropping</em> them or by clicking <em>‚Äúadd files‚Äù</em>. Once you have files in the working set, those are the <em>only files that the model will focus on.</em></p>

<hr />

<p><em>Okay, enough theory,</em> let me show you <strong>how I‚Äôve used Edits for some AL workloads.</strong></p>

<p>A bit of a backstory.</p>

<p>We were recently working with <strong><em><a href="https://wair.ai/">Wair</a></em></strong>, a partner that has a backend service for <strong>AI inventory predictions</strong>. They wanted to make life easier for ISVs and VARs in the world of BC who would want to integrate a BC solution with their backend system.</p>

<p>Usually, each partner would have to develop logic that <em>authenticates</em> against the backend, <em>builds</em> the HTTP request, and then <em>sends</em> the request in the correct format. To make life easier we built a library app that introduces a set of temporary tables that match the <strong>HTTP request payload</strong>, and a set of codeunits that turn these tables into <em>JSON payloads</em> and send the request to the correct <em>endpoint</em>. That way, the BC partner needs to insert a record in the table and call a procedure with that table. <strong>That‚Äôs it.</strong></p>

<p>You can imagine that when the backend introduces a new endpoint, we want to add new tables and codeunits to support it.</p>

<p>So, I tried if I could add a table with <em>Edits</em> that would follow all the conventions we have in other tables.</p>

<p>In this case, <strong>Brand is the new endpoint</strong> I want to support. I create a new Brand.Table.al file (I‚Äôve noticed <em>Copilot</em> sometimes struggles with creating files, so I prefer to create them on my own and let Copilot fill them in), and pull it in the working set. I added one of the <strong>existing tables</strong>, so Copilot knows how I want to have it <strong>structured</strong>, and here comes the prompt:</p>

<p><em>Create a Brand table with brand ID, code, and description. It should follow the structure of the Category table.</em></p>

<p>Seconds later</p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/edits-table.png" alt="Copilot Edits with Table" /></p>

<p>Everything on the left side was just generated. <strong>Of course, it struggles with Object IDs.</strong> No one likes object IDs. Not even Copilot! :D</p>

<p>But you can see that in seconds I have a table with the <em>namespace</em>, <em>properties</em> that we use, and even a <em>check for non-empty code</em>.</p>

<p>You could say <strong><em>‚ÄúYeah, but that‚Äôs a simple example‚Äù</em></strong>. Fair, but I‚Äôd argue the <strong><em>easy and boring parts are the best ones to automate.</em></strong> Yes, you could <em>copy-paste</em> the other table and change a few things until it fits your new use case, but <strong>a)</strong> you‚Äôre bound to miss something, <strong>b)</strong> you‚Äôll still be slower, and <strong>c)</strong> wouldn‚Äôt you rather spend your time on something else?  Who wants to work on boring stuff anyway?</p>

<hr />

<p>I suggest you always <strong><em>finish the Edits session</em></strong> when you‚Äôre done with those files and open a new one. <strong><em>LLM models operate on a limited context window</em></strong>, and even though we hear about context windows in the millions of tokens, anything <strong><em>above ~8k tokens</em></strong> starts to give <strong><em>diminishing results</em></strong>, so it‚Äôs best to start a new session every time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/copilot-close.png" alt="Copilot Edits - Close session" /></p>

<hr />

<p>Anyway, let me continue with the example of what else I <em>‚Äúmade in seconds‚Äù</em>. We now have the table for our new endpoint. We need a codeunit that will <em>transform</em> the content of this <strong>table into a JSON payload</strong> and call the appropriate <em>endpoint</em>.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll again create an empty file where I want my codeunit for handling the <em>Brand API</em> to be created:</p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/codeunit-empty.png" alt="Empty Codeunit" /></p>

<p>This time, I‚Äôm pulling in my <em>empty file</em>, my <em>existing codeunit</em>, and the <em>table we just created</em>, so Copilot knows what properties are available for brands. The prompt is straightforward</p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/codeunit-prompt.png" alt="Copilot Edits prompt for Codeunit" /></p>

<p>And a second later, boom, a <strong>codeunit that builds the payload and sends the request</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/edits-codeunit.png" alt="Copilot Edits with Codeunit" /></p>

<p>The important part here is that <strong><em>I passed a similar implementation as part of the context.</em></strong> Out of curiosity, I tried a similar prompt <strong>without</strong> including the Category API Handler. I was still <strong>pleasantly surprised</strong> by the result:</p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/edits-codeunit-raw.png" alt="Copilot Edits with Raw Codeunit" /></p>

<p>It doesn‚Äôt follow the structure I need for this project, but <strong>it knows how HTTP requests are built and sent in AL.</strong> This would still be a cool start if I needed to build my first handler that I could later spread across other tables.</p>

<hr />

<p>Okay, <strong>tables?</strong> <em>Check.</em> <strong>Codeunits?</strong> <em>Check.</em> <strong>Pages?</strong> <em>Eh, trust me, it works, I don‚Äôt want to make more screenshots.</em> <strong>What about tests?</strong> <em>Same principle.</em> Do you have similar tests? Then yes. Look:</p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/edits-tests.png" alt="Copilot Edits with Tests" /></p>

<p>These tests worked because <strong>the overall structure was very similar between the existing objects</strong> and the new ones. But testing can really become a breeze. <strong><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vjeko">Vjeko</a></em></strong> had an awesome session on it at <strong>Directions</strong>, and hopefully, he‚Äôll do an extended version at <strong><a href="https://www.bctechdays.com/event">BC Tech Days</a></strong>. He‚Äôs been preaching <strong>Interfaces as a way of truly testing your code in isolation</strong> for a few years now, and with Copilot, most of those <strong>tests can now be generated.</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>But here‚Äôs the catch.</em></strong> You have to use <strong>interfaces</strong> in your code. Your procedures have to have a <strong>single responsibility</strong>. Your files have to be <strong>small</strong>. To get the most out of <em>AI</em>, your code should be <strong>SOLID</strong>. But you should be following <em>SOLID</em> principles for your own sake anyway, so take this as another nudge towards spending more time on writing <em>SOLID</em> code if you haven‚Äôt started already.</p>

<hr />

<p>I know not everything is a <strong>greenfield project</strong> and you sometimes have to deal with big codeunits. Here are two prompts that I‚Äôve used on legacy code with Edits</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Move global procedures to local</em><br />
It analyses all the global variables and moves them to procedures if they‚Äôre not used anywhere else.</li>
  <li><em>Extract procedure X to codeunit Y</em><br />
Unlike a simple extraction, it will also add a codeunit variable in the local scope and replace the call with the codeunit‚Äôs procedure call.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both will still start to <strong>take too long</strong> if your files go <strong>beyond 500 LoC</strong>, so please, for the sake of AI, keep your files small :P</p>

<hr />

<p>Even in perfect conditions, Copilot may sometimes take long or even get stuck. It happens, it‚Äôs best to <strong>accept it</strong>, stop the execution, discard the changes, and try again:</p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/edits-stop.png" alt="Copilot Edits Stop" /></p>

<hr />

<p><em>This section is getting long</em>; we have to move on. But I really am excited about this feature, it brings so much joy to me when I get to <em>blitz through code</em>. <strong><em>Coding is the boring part, it‚Äôs the problem-solving that‚Äôs the fun part.</em></strong> That‚Äôs also why I don‚Äôt believe <strong>AI is replacing devs</strong>, it‚Äôs just helping with the boring parts‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs take a look at more incremental edits next.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="inline-chat">Inline Chat</h2>

<p>This one was available for a while, but I never really found a use case for it that I‚Äôd like. Well, now I have a couple, so let me give you some ideas.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="add-comments">Add comments</h4>

<p>I‚Äôm right now working on a <strong>legacy project</strong>. <em>Large files</em>, not much new is created, it‚Äôs about <em>maintaining the existing code</em>. In the days of <em>NAV</em>, we didn‚Äôt have the <em>internal</em> access modifier, so everything was either <em>public</em> or <em>global</em>. The <strong>problem with global</strong> is that you can‚Äôt change a thing, as it‚Äôs a <strong>breaking change</strong>, so on this project, we decided to make all procedures internal. If a procedure needs to be public, it should have <strong>XML documentation</strong>.</p>

<p>So, you start with <em>three slashes</em> to get the docs snippet</p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/inline-snippet.png" alt="Inline Chat - Comments Snippet" /></p>

<p>You accept it, but then you see this: üòÆ</p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/inline-docs-empty.png" alt="Inline Chat - Empty XML Document" /></p>

<p><em>Well, that‚Äôs going to be boring‚Ä¶</em> The names are self-explanatory, but we agreed on what we agreed, and I have to fill in all the parameters. <em>If I try to autocomplete this, I‚Äôll tab for a while‚Ä¶</em></p>

<p><strong>Ctrl + i to the rescue!</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/inline-docs-full.png" alt="Inline Chat - Full XML Documentation" /></p>

<p>You could also select the whole procedure and prompt with <strong><em>‚Äú/doc‚Äù</em></strong>, but I found this way to give me better results.</p>

<p>Am I super proud of this comment? No, but hey, <strong>legacy has better fires we can fight.</strong> :D</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="subscribe-to-events">Subscribe to events</h4>

<p>Subscribing to events is something <strong>very common</strong> for an AL developer. Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd go about <strong><em>before Copilot.</em></strong> Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm extending <em>Sales-Post</em>. I‚Äôd first find the event I like:</p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/sales-post-event.png" alt="Event in Sales - Post codeunit" /></p>

<p>Next, in my subscriber codeunit, I‚Äôd use the <strong><em>eventsub</em></strong> snippet:</p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/event-subscriber-snippet.png" alt="Event Subscriber snippet" /></p>

<p>Start filling out all the parameters‚Ä¶</p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/snippet-1.png" alt="Fill the codeunit in the subscriber" /></p>

<p>Go back to the <em>Sales-Post</em> codeunit and copy the event name‚Ä¶</p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/snippet-2.png" alt="Fill the event name in the subscriber" /></p>

<p>Remove element name, think for a second about skipping the event on missing permissions or license, but then just put <strong>false</strong>, because hey, I always put false‚Ä¶</p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/snippet-3.png" alt="Fill remaining parameters in the subscriber" /></p>

<p>Go back to Sales-Post and copy the signature of the event publisher‚Ä¶</p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/snippet-4.png" alt="Add Event signature to subscriber" /></p>

<p>And now finally, I can <em>add my logic</em>.</p>

<p>I mean, it‚Äôs <strong>not the slowest process</strong> in the world, but here‚Äôs my <strong>new alternative.</strong></p>

<p>I still find the event publisher, but I immediately copy the event signature, go to my codeunit, press <strong>Ctrl + i</strong> and ask for a subscriber</p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/copilot-subscribe.png" alt="Prompt Copilot for a subscriber" /></p>

<p>Seconds later‚Ä¶</p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/copilot-subscribe-generated.png" alt="Copilot generated subscriber" /></p>

<p>This is now my preferred way!</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="add-fields">Add fields</h4>

<p>I mentioned earlier that Edits start to <strong>break down on large files.</strong> I try to keep them <strong>sub-300 LoC.</strong> But that‚Äôs not always an option, so Inline Chat helps in those cases. I use it for adding multiple fields:</p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/inline-fields.png" alt="Inline Chat - Add Fields" /></p>

<p><em>Perfect? No. Faster? Yup.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>A few more prompts that I occasionally use</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Forward slash</em><br />
a very lazy way to switch all the pasted paths from backslashes to forward slashes as I‚Äôd otherwise have to escape them in JSON files üòÖ</li>
  <li><em>Add label for regex that matches 123-1414-2124-223</em><br />
Quickly get regex patterns that match the validations I‚Äôm looking for</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="chat">Chat</h2>

<p>This one I admit I don‚Äôt use as much for AL, but it‚Äôs quite useful for other languages. You can probably tell that <strong>I love Copilot Edits.</strong> But Edits want to implement something <strong>too quickly.</strong> Like that junior developer that wants to code before I‚Äôm <em>halfway through my sentence‚Ä¶</em></p>

<p>That‚Äôs when I turn to chat as a starting point. I discuss what I want to do, and <strong>when I‚Äôm happy with the suggested code, I pass that suggestion to Edits</strong> so it gets added.</p>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/chat-edits.png" alt="Pass Chat Context to Edits" /></p>

<p>Edits will take the conversation as context and will apply the changes in the necessary files. Chat is a nice <em>‚Äúsafeguard‚Äù</em> when I‚Äôm not completely sure how I want to solve the problem.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs also useful when the file is <strong>too big for Edits</strong> (&gt; 500 Loc), as I can always copy-paste the suggested snippet into the correct place.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="a-few-final-nuggets">A few final nuggets</h2>

<p>Here are a few more tiny notes that can help you make the most out of <strong>GitHub Copilot:</strong></p>

<h4 id="commit-message">Commit message</h4>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/commit-message.png" alt="Suggest commit message" /></p>

<p>Generate commit messages for staged changes.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="rename">Rename</h4>

<p><img src="/images/copilotintro/rename.png" alt="Suggest names" /></p>

<p>Renaming suggestions for just about everything that can be renamed</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="different-models">Different models</h4>

<p>If you‚Äôre only working with AL, <strong>stick to Claude.</strong> If you‚Äôre working with other languages, here‚Äôs how I see and choose models</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Claude:</em></strong> Great for generating new code, but gets ‚Äúdrunk‚Äù quickly if there‚Äôs too much context and starts suggesting weird things</li>
  <li><strong><em>o1:</em></strong> Great for reviewing existing code. It takes longer and there‚Äôs a rate limit after which you have to wait for some time before using o1 again</li>
  <li><strong><em>GPT 4o:</em></strong> fastest responses but seems to shoot from the hip a lot. Less accurate results with complex requests.</li>
  <li><strong><em>o1-mini:</em></strong> Somewhere between o1 and GPT 4o, It‚Äôs faster than o1, and better at reviewing code than GPT 4o. I usually use it when I hit the rate limit of o1.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Gemini 1.5:</em></strong> No idea yet, I‚Äôm still waiting for it to be released</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="free-vs-pro-tier">Free vs Pro Tier</h4>

<p>The <em>free tier</em> right now gives you</p>
<ul>
  <li>Access to <strong>Claude 3.5 Sonnet</strong> models</li>
  <li><em>2000</em> Code completions per month</li>
  <li><em>50</em> chats per month (edits and chat count towards the same limit)</li>
</ul>

<p>In my opinion, that‚Äôs enough for you to test these features out if they work for you. But as I mentioned at the beginning, even the <strong>autocomplete brings enough value to AL developers</strong> that it‚Äôs worth the 20$ for a Pro license.</p>

<p>Pro has <em>unlimited completions</em> and chats (except the o1 rate limit)</p>

<h4 id="quick-recap">Quick Recap</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Copilot Edits</em></strong> ‚Äì Best for large-scale code changes, refactoring, and generating new files.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Inline Chat</em></strong> ‚Äì Great for small additions, comments, and repetitive edits.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Copilot Chat</em></strong> ‚Äì A fallback when edits feel too aggressive or when brainstorming solutions.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Autocomplete</em></strong> ‚Äì The most familiar feature ‚Äì saves time with quick code suggestions (worth the Pro tier alone).</li>
  <li><strong><em>Model Tip</em></strong> ‚Äì Use Claude 3.5 Sonnet for AL work; it handles AL better than GPT-4o.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Scope Control</em></strong> ‚Äì Keep files small and focus Copilot on relevant files for better suggestions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-remarks">Final remarks</h2>

<p>This was a very long post. But that‚Äôs because there‚Äôs so much to say about this <strong>awesome tool</strong> that we have. I honestly believe it‚Äôs the <strong>next big thing.</strong> Then again, I‚Äôve been an enthusiast for a while :P</p>

<p>Anyway, I‚Äôm playing with the idea of <strong>going deeper into this topic</strong> at some conferences this year. <em>Share more examples, show more pitfalls, and explain more of the under-the-hood parts.</em> What do you think? I‚Äôd love to know your opinion.
