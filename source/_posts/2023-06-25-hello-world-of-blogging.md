Mama, look, I have a blog!

I've been wanting to have a place where I can dump my ideas around Business Central tech for the past few years now. It took me a while, I know, but now I have it! I've never really done any writing in the past, so this will be an interesting journey for me, and hopefully for you as well.
The areas I want to explore and share with you are:
- Edges of AL, points, where AL patterns breaks, and where we need to go beyond the borders of BC
- Weird situations with AL I come across, that I want to document for myself and the next poor soul that needs to deal with them
- Recap of Conference sessions I present, to have them in a written and searchable format
- Recap of BC Conferences, I wish, everyone could attend them, but for those that cannot, I want to share key takeaways, as the community findings are always intriguing

I think this will be a fun activity for me, and hopefully sometimes insightful for you!
