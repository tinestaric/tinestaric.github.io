Hey, welcome to the tech blog of Tine Stariƒç, a Software Developer at Companial, a homebrewer, a speaker, and mostly just an enthusiastic youngling in the world of Business Central. This blog was a long time coming, but now I finally have a place where I can dump my brain on all tech topics around Business Central and AL. I've worked on all sorts and sizes of AL projects, finding various different ways where we pushed the language to the limit. I want to start sharing some of these places with you, to help you when you reach the same situations. I'm passionate about Business Central, Developer Experience and Beer, and I hope this blog will become my way of sharing these passions with you.
