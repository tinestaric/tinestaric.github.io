Hey, welcome to my tech blog!<br><br> I'm Tine Stariƒç, a Software Developer at Companial, a homebrewer, a speaker, and mostly just an enthusiastic youngling in the world of Business Central. <br>This blog has been a long time coming, but now I finally have a place where I can dump my brain on all tech topics around Business Central and AL. I've worked on all sorts of AL projects, of various sizes, finding different ways in which we pushed the language to its limit. I want to start sharing some of these experiences with you to help you when you encounter similar situations. <br>I'm passionate about Business Central, Developer Experience and Beer, and I hope this blog will become my way of sharing these passions with you.
