        <title>A Blogging Journey Begins!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally! I have a blog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past few years, I’ve been wanting to have a place where I can share my ideas about Business Central tech. It took me a while, I know, but now I finally have it! I haven’t really done much writing in the past, so this will be an interesting journey for me, and hopefully for you as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The areas I want to explore and share with you are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The edges of AL, where AL patterns break, and where we need to go beyond the borders of BC.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Weird situations with AL that I come across, which I want to document for myself and the next poor soul that needs to deal with them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recaps of conference sessions I present, so that they are in a written and searchable format.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recaps of BC conferences. I wish everyone could attend them, but for those who cannot, I want to share key takeaways, as the community findings are always intriguing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this will be a fun activity for me, and hopefully sometimes insightful for you!&lt;/p&gt;
