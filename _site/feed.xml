        <title>A Blogging Journey Begins!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally! I have a blog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been wanting to have a place where I can dump my ideas around Business Central tech for the past few years now. It took me a while, I know, but now I have it! I’ve never really done any writing in the past, so this will be an interesting journey for me, and hopefully for you as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The areas I want to explore and share with you are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Edges of AL, points, where AL patterns breaks, and where we need to go beyond the borders of BC&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Weird situations with AL I come across, that I want to document for myself and the next poor soul that needs to deal with them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recap of Conference sessions I present, to have them in a written and searchable format&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recap of BC Conferences, I wish, everyone could attend them, but for those that cannot, I want to share key takeaways, as the community findings are always intriguing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this will be a fun activity for me, and hopefully sometimes insightful for you!&lt;/p&gt;
